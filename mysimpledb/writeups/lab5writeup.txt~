Report for Lab 3
----------------

After you complete lab 5, please answer the following questions.

1. What is your name?  If you work with a partner, be sure to write both of your names.

	Dong Mai

2. What did you think of this assignment?

	Very challenging

3. What was the hardest part of this assignment?

	To understand how the test works

4. Describe any missing or incomplete elements of your code.

	I didn't pass the last 3 tests in the system test TransactionTest due to the lack of time.

5. Roughly how long did you spend working on this lab?

	roughly 6-7 hours every week.

6. Describe your lock manager implementation.  Here are some specific questions to answer:

a) Where is your lock manager located?  (I.e., is it a separate class, part of BufferPool, etc.)

	It's a nested class inside bufferpool

b) What specific information do you store and how do you store it?  

	I store the list of requests for a page in a queue, a list of requests that are holding the lock in another queue. Request object includes 		TransactionId and Permissions.

c) Briefly describe what happens when a new transaction requests a page.  I.e., walk thru how the lock manager decides whether or not to grant the request.  Your description should reference the data structures that describe in part (b).

	I just put the new request into the end of requests queue. However, if it is an upgrade request, it should be put to the beginning of the 		queue.

d) Briefly explain how you manage locks when inserting a tuple into a HeapFile.  In particular, how do you acquire/release locks when looking for a page to insert.

	For each page that I'm considering, acquire a write lock on that page and check if I can insert the tuple in there. Release the lock if the 		page is full or the tuple is successfully inserted.
