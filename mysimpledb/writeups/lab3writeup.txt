Report for Lab 3
----------------

Answer the questions from the lab description here.  Questions 8 and 9 do not require answers.

1. Classes that implement DbIterator interface: Aggregate, Delete, Filter, HashEquiJoin, Insert, Join, Operator, OrderBy, Project, SeqScan, TupleIterator

2. Subclasses of the class Operator: Aggregate, Delete, Filter, HashEquiJoin, Insert, Join, OrderBy, Project

3. Select is supported by Filter class.
   Join is supported by HashEquiJoin class and Join class.
   Projection is supported by Project class.

4. Because Filter is a subclass of Operator and it inherits the methods next and hasNext from Operator.

5. 
while iterR.hasNext():
   t = iterR.next()
   if t matches predicate:
       return t
return null

6.
list = []
while iterR.hasNext():
    t1 = iterR.next()
    while iterS.hasNext():
        t2 = iterS.next()
        if t1 and t2 match join predicate:
	    tNew = merge(t1, t2)   
            list.append( tNew )
    iterS.rewind()
return list

7.
while iterR.hasNext() or iterS.hasNext():
    if t1 == null:
        t1 = iterR.next()
    if not iterS.hasNext():
        t1 = iterR.next()
        iterS.rewind()
    while iterS.hasNext():
        t2 = iterS.next()
        if t1 and t2 match join predicate:
	    tNew = merge(t1, t2)
            return tNew    
return null
